# offline_signature_verification

&emsp; The code folder consists of 6 sub-foders: DLmethod, HFmethod, auxiliary, odds, template and test. Detials can about these sub-folders are shown 
in the following instruction:
1. **DLmethod**: offline verificaion algs based on DeepLearning methods
2. **HFmethod**: offline verificaion algs based on Handcrafted Features and traditional machine learning methods.
3. **auxilary**: dataloading and preprocessing code
4. **template**: standard DeepLearing structures.
5. **test**: codes to deploy some experiments.

&emsp: The pair_ind folder contains the pathes of the signature image
